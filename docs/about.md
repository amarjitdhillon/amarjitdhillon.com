# About me 
Hey there! 👋 my name is Amarjit Singh Dhillon.

 I did my elementry schooling and bachelors from Punjab, India and then moved to Canada to persue research based masters in big-data and real-time data analytics. Some of my interests are:

- Problem solving in general 🖥️ 
- Music. I love to listen all kinds of traditional indian music, folk, classic, sufi, desi punjabi and western music as well.
- Exploring wilderness: I love going for walks on whatever new trail I can find.
-  Going to new places: Now that I have travel perks with Air Canada, so I am hoping to go to various countries and get a first hand experience of their culture, cusine, art and food (of course 😋)
- I love taking photographs 📸 
- Physics used to be my favourite subject in high school, so I grew up wondering about black holes, multi-verse, parallel universe, where does this universe ends and what the hell what there when time just started ( I mean what was there when there was nothing, and what was there when there was nothing 😝)
- Politics: Ah!, I was never interested in politics in early stages of my life. As you grow up, you realize how it has effected your existence and shaped various thing aroud you. So, I would say I love seeing what is going around nowadays.
